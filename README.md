# Layout (TOP Flexbox Final Project)

I constructed the layout for the Landing Page project by referring to the provided visual reference of the layout, which can be found here:

Afterwards, I customized this layout with a theme inspired by the gothic metal genre and my passion for guitars. I really enjoy gothic stuff. You can check it out here:

 That's all.
